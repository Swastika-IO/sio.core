Begin by logging into the “administration area” or the back end of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing “portal” after your domain name (e.g. http://example.com/en-us/portal). Now log into Swastika I/O Core CMS using your username and password.

## Start at the Top

After logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard.

This is where the organization of your site begins – and this is just the start.
